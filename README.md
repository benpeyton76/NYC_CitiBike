# NYC_CitiBike

Overview:

The purpose of this project is to build visualizations for a group of investors that want to explore the possibility of starting a CitiBike business in Des Moines, IA. The investors asked a team to research CitiBike data from New York City to see if CitiBike in Des Moines is a viable venture for them. By using the NYC CitiBike data in Tableau, we are able to help the investors visualize pertinent data in a way that is to the point and easy to comprehend. By using all of the data from NYC, we will be able to help the investors decide whether they think Des Moines CitiBike is the way to go. 

Results:

In this project we are accessing the following data for visualization:

* The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders,

* The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week,

* The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

As shown in the above visualization, the length of time bikes are checked out are primarily one hour or less, with the peak average of 4 minutes.

We are also able to show, by gender, who keeps the bikes checked out. As we can see, males tend to use the bikes more than females. We also have an unknown variable due to gender not being recorded.

The heat map shown reflects that the majority of starttimes that fall within the weekdays are during work hours. This data suggests that people check out bikes coming to and from work.

The next heat map shows which gender checks out the bikes through the week and the times they check them out.

The third heatmap reflects the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype. It reflects the regular subscribers, in speculation are people who have jobs in the immediate area. The non-subscribers are likely tourists.

Based on starting locations, most checkouts occur near downtown/business district.

Ending locations are also mostly located in the downtown/business district.


Summary:

Based on the New York City CitiBike data, bike checkouts mostly occur in the downtown/business district as the above two visualizations show. They mostly occur during the morning and evening rush. Most of CitiBike's checkouts are transactions between the company and its subscribers. Although Des Moines is a much smaller town than NYC, I believe that a scaled back version of NYC CitiBike would be successful based on the following criteria:
* Put most locations in the downtown area,
* Push for subscriptions. Possibly advertise an introductory rate or special to attract people to the service,
* Find ways to attract more women to utilize the service,
* And spread out. Do trial runs of CitiBike outside of the downtown area to see how well it is received.
